# Python assignment 2: Using Loops
## using a while loop to create a countdown
i = int(input("Please enter a number: ")) ## asks the user to enter a number to count down from
while i > 0: ## starts the while loop, loop counts down while the variable i remains above 0
    print(i) ## prints each iteration of the countdown
    i -= 1 ## subtracts 1 from the current i, this creates the countdown
print("Blast off!") ## prints the final message once the loop ends

## Create a multiplication table using a for loop
i = int(input("Please enter a number: ")) ## asks the user to enter a number
for j in range(1, 11): ## creates a for loop to run through numbers 1 to 10
    print(i, "x", j, "=", i * j, end=" ") ## prints each iteration of the multiplication table
    print() ## starts a new line after each iteration

## using loops to create a factorial function
n = int(input("Please enter a number: ")) ## ask the user to enter a number
answer = 1 ## set the starting variable equal to 1
for i in range(1, n + 1): ## create a for loop to run through the numbers 1 to the number entered
    answer *= i ## multiply the variable defined by each iteration of i
print(f"{answer}") ## print the resulting answer
